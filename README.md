# web-scraping

Problem Statement:

Write a web scraper to collect google news.

Both, main news and sub news are to be collected from the whole page. This news is to be preprocessed, summarized, and stored in separate tables. Write a small function to search exact words like surge, acquisitions, and IPO (initial public offering), print the sentences if search matched. Search exact words should be carried out on raw news text and not on summarized one.
